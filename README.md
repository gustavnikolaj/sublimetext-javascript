# Sublime Text snippets for JavaScript

I got tired of the default snippets in Sublime Text, so I decided to redo them. The files in the root of this repo are, besides the LICENSE and README files, here to override the default snippets which cannot easily be removed otherwise in Sublime Text 3.

If you have an awesome snippet that you think I cannot survive without, please do send a pull request.
